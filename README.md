# HarrisCornerDetector
An implementation of the Harris Corner Detector. The main implementation of a class-based version of the algorithm is given in HarrisCornerDetector.py for step by step use. It is un-optimized at the moment. The HarrisCorner.ipynb notebook is an example notebook for using the algorithm. 

## Requirements for repo
Requires Python version of OpenCV, matplotlib, and numpy. I used conda for the project but any package manager will do.
